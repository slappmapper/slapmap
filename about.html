          SLAPMAP is a lived-in, fully biased guide to home/the east bay made by one person with affected opinions on too many things. i yearn for a non-comoditized slappy atlas every time i travel + i have the unshakeable urge to map what slaps for my homies, so here ya go. 
        <br /><br />
          full disclosure: i'm heavily involved in one of the 100+ businesses on this map; however, you're going to have to trust quasi-anonymous me that all thoughts are honest and not influenced by paid advertizing or personal relationships.
